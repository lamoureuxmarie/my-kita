<h1>My Kita - Make Kindergarten happen</h1>
<p>
My kita is a application designed to simplify the search of a kindergarten in Berlin, by helping parents be more organised and keeping track of their progress.
</p>
<p>
This app was imagined by Marie as part of our final project for Le Wagon Bootcamp - and built in collaboration with Missato and Daniel.
</p>
<p>
The app includes: 
<ul>
  <li>A search tool, to search kindergartens by neighborhood</li>
  <li>A map to display the results</li>
  <li>A task manager - that allows to save kitas in a list, add comments to them and update the status of each task.</li>
  <li>The possibility to contact kitas and save email templates.</li>
  <li>The possibility to set reminders, that the user receives by message on Telegram.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
 The kitas informations are scraped from the Kita Navigator Berlin.
