<h1>My Kita - Make Kindergarten happen</h1>
<p>
My kita is a application designed to simplify the search of a kindergarten in Berlin, by helping parents be more organised and keeping track of their progress.
</p>
<p>
This app was imagined by myself as part of my final project for Le Wagon Bootcamp. My two classmates, Missato and Daniel, built it with me.
</p>
<p>
The app includes: 
<ul>
  <li>A search tool, to search kindergartens by neighborhood</li>
  <li>A map to display the results</li>
  <li>A task manager - that allows to save kitas, add comments and update status in the list.</li>
  <li>The possibility to contact kitas and save email templates.</li>
  <li>The possibility to set reminders, that the user receives on his Telegram.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
 The kitas informations are scraped from the Kita Navigator Berlin.
